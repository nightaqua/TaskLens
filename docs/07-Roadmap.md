# Roadmap & Future Plans

TaskLens is actively evolving. While the current version focuses on core task management and native Obsidian integration, the architecture is designed to support significant future extensions.

Below is a list of features, widgets, and integrations we are exploring for future releases.

## 🎨 New Widgets & Visualizations

* **Advanced Calendar View:** A traditional month/week calendar layout to complement the existing Timeline view.
* **Enhanced Statistics Tracking:** Historical completion rates and productivity metrics.
* **Advanced Filtering UI:** More granular controls for priority levels, tags, and custom metadata.

## 🔄 External Integrations

* **Google Calendar / iOS Alternatives:** Two-way syncing or visualization of external calendar events directly alongside your Obsidian tasks.
* **Smartwatch & Time Tracking:** Exploring integrations with smartwatch apps to track time spent on specific tasks, visualizing that data inside the TaskLens Statistics widget.
* **Export Capabilities:** Export your task lists and timelines to various external formats.

## 📚 Course & Project Management

* **Semester Switching:** Support for defining multiple semesters with specific date ranges.
* **Per-Course Colors:** Expanding the Smart Topic Colors to allow explicit per-course color coding.
